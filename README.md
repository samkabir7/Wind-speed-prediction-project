# Wind-speed-prediction-project
A wind speed prediction project aims to develop a model that forecasts wind speed based on historical data and environmental factors. This can involve using machine learning techniques, such as regression or time series analysis, to predict future wind speeds based on past trends, weather conditions, geographic factors, and other relevant data. The model could be applied in various industries like renewable energy (wind turbines), agriculture, and weather forecasting. The goal is to provide accurate predictions to optimize operations and decision-making processes.
